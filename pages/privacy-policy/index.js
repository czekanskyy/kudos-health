        </p>

        <ul className='list-disc ml-4'>
          <li>
            What personally identifiable information the Company, or a third party acting on the Company&apos;s behalf, collects through our Service and how we
            use it;
          </li>

        </ul>

        <p className='font-bold'>User Account and Data Privacy</p>

        <p>
          Each organisation subscribing for the KudosHealth Sites and the Services will have access to an “Moderator/Admin Account” through which a person
          designated by the organisation may monitor aggregated data produced by the collective usage of those within the organisation.{' '}

            Only certain types of data are presented to the Admin Account such as a user&apos;s KudosPoints, KudosCoins, username, departments, locations,
            rewards redeemed &amp; challenges which they are participating in. Data which is not presented on the admin/moderator account is an individual users
            activity data collected from tracking apps &amp; devices, their sex, height, weight &amp; date of birth, or any personal health information.
          </span>{' '}
          It is the responsibility of each individual user to protect the privacy of all personal information entered on the KudosHealth Sites by never sharing
          individual account information, usernames, or passwords with other individuals.

        </p>

        <p>

          see your <span className='underline'>KudosPoints &amp; Leader-board positions.</span> No other account information or associated data will be shared
          without prior approval of the user. In addition, you and the requesting party will be able to send private messages to one another. Please be advised
          that we do not perform any background searches on our users and that you it is your responsibility to carefully select which friend requests to
          accept.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span className='italic'>
            At no time will KudosHealth or any employee of KudosHealth share, sell or otherwise distribute individual user data or personal information that can
            be reasonably identified with a specific user account without the prior consent of the individual user. We may choose to aggregate and redistribute
            data without providing information identifying specific subscribing organisations, companies or individual users without prior consent.
          </span>
        </p>

        <p className='font-bold'>No Transfer of Personal Information for Direct Marketing</p>

        <p className='font-bold'>Use of Contact Information</p>

        <p>
          We may use your email address to send you information about our Services or to market to you. You may unsubscribe from these messages by following the
          instructions contained within the messages or the instructions on the KudosHealth Sites. If you email us with a request or question or have provided
          us with your email address, we may keep your message, email address, and contact information to respond to your request or otherwise follow up with

        </p>

        <p className='font-bold'>No Public Sharing of Your Data.</p>

        <p> We do not allow the public to see your personal information.</p>

        <p className='font-bold'>Sharing Non-Personal Information</p>

        <p>
          Because non-personal information does not identify who you are, we do not limit the ways we may use or share non-personal information. We may share
          non-personal information, for example, with your Sponsor and with our employees, affiliates, suppliers, agents, other businesses and the government,
          and we expressly reserve the right to share non-personal information without limitation.
        </p>

        <p className='font-bold'>Your Personal Information</p>

        <p>
          “Personal Information” refers to information that specifically identifies you as an individual, such as your full name, telephone number, e-mail
          address, postal address, or certain account numbers.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Service may offer the opportunity for you to sign up to receive email messages, newsletters, or other communications from the Service in
          connection with one or more features or programmes within the Service. In order for you to sign up for these communications, we may ask for contact
          information, such as name, mailing address and email address. We may also offer you the opportunity to sign up to receive email messages or mailings
          from companies with which the Company is affiliated or does business that we think may be of interest to you. If you decide to sign up for these
          communications, we may ask for your contact information for that purpose.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you choose to participate in the Service, you may disclose certain health and health-related information to us for purposes of your participation
          in the Service. Such information may include relevant health history on topics such as height, weight, physical measurements, blood pressure, mental
          health, and behaviour&apos;s such as smoking and exercise.
        </p>

        <p>
          By completing the questions on a health survey and submitting the answers, you are consenting to allow the use and disclosure of this information in a
          manner protected by and defined in this Privacy Policy to help identify and provide content, products and resources relevant to you.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Service may include features that give you the opportunity to provide us with personal information about yourself. You do not have to provide us
          with personal information if you do not want to; however, that may limit your ability to use the Service or certain functions of the Service or to
          request certain services or information. Collection by us of personal information is sometimes necessary when you contact us or decide to take
          advantage of various features of the Service. We may request that you provide us with personal information on a voluntary basis in certain areas of
          the Service, such as your delivery address for incentives/reward which must be delivered to you directly for either KudosHealth or a reward
          sponsor/provider.
        </p>

        <p className='font-bold'>How We Will Use Your Information</p>

        <p>
          The Company will use your information to customise your experience and provide relevant offers and content, or other services to you. We may combine
          personal information that you provide us through the Service with other information we have received from you, whether online or offline, or from
          other sources such as our business partners or your sponsoring organisation. We may use personal information to contact you through any contact

          Information agrees to safeguard it in substantially the same manner as described in this Privacy Policy, and in accordance with all applicable laws
          and regulations.
        </p>

        <p className='font-bold'>Aggregated, De-identified Information</p>

        <p>
          We may provide third parties, including to our corporate customers, with information about you and other users from which we have removed all
          identifiers and that can no longer be used to identify you. We may not limit the third parties&apos; use of the aggregate information, except that we
          do require third parties to whom we disclose aggregate information to agree that they will not attempt to make this information personally
          identifiable, including by combining it with other databases.
        </p>

        <p className='font-bold'>Disclosure of Automatically Collected Non-Personal Information</p>

        </p>

        <p className='font-bold'>Business Events</p>

        <p>
          In the event the Company goes (or proposes to go) through a business event, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, reorganisation, or sale
          of a portion of its assets, your Personal Information may be shared with parties connected with the proposed transaction as part of the due diligence
          process and may be part of the assets acquired by and transferred to a new party taking over the business. The information transferred or shared
          remains subject to the promises made in our then-current Privacy Policy unless you agree to new terms.
        </p>

        <p className='font-bold'>Legal Compliance</p>

        <p>
          We may share personal information in response to a court order, subpoena, search warrant, law or regulation. We may cooperate with law enforcement
          authorities in investigating and prosecuting activities that are illegal, violate our rules, or may be harmful to other visitors. We also may share
          personal information if we in good faith believe that doing so is necessary to protect and defend our legal rights and property, to protect against
          misuse or unauthorised use of the Service by other parties, or to protect the personal safety or property of users of the Service or the general
          public. We may not provide you with notice prior to disclosure in such cases.
        </p>

        <p className='font-bold'>Health &amp; Wellness Research</p>

        <p>
          The Company reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to use personal information you may provide in your participation in the Service to document
          positive health and wellness outcomes and to validate that engagement by users of the Service is correlated with health improvements. The results of
          those studies and analyses may be shared by the Company with third parties.
        </p>

        <p>
          Except in those instances described in the preceding, however, the information we use for such purposes will consist of aggregate or non-personally
          identified data and will accordingly not constitute personal information under this Policy.
        </p>

        <p className='font-bold'>Our Right to Verify Information</p>

        <p>
          As a user of the Service, you may participate in activities to earn Points and to receive Rewards and other benefits, which participation may require
          your reporting of certain information to us such as whether you have completed a step or activity or satisfied a programme requirement. We reserve the
          right to confirm or verify the accuracy of any such information by contacting third parties. The third parties we contact for verification may include
          your Sponsor.
        </p>

        <p>
          Misuse of the service can result in your being removed from the system, with the loss of all points collected and loss of any entitlement to any
          reward provided by the system or third parties.
        </p>

        <p>

        </p>

        <p className='font-bold'>Information Security, Retention, and Data Integrity</p>

        <span className='underline'>
          <p>
            We use a number of methods of physical security (such as locks and alarm systems), electronic security (such as passwords and encryption methods),
            and procedural security (such as rules regarding the handling and use of information), designed to protect the security and integrity of information
            submitted through the Service. Due to the nature of the Internet and online communications, however, we cannot guarantee that any information
            transmitted online will remain absolutely confidential, and we are not liable for the illegal acts of third parties such as criminal hackers.
          </p>

          <p>
            Maintaining the security of information transmitted to us or by us through the Service is of utmost concern to the Company. No data transmissions
            over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, however, and it is possible that email messages you send through the Service, like nearly all
            non-encrypted Internet communications, may be accessed and viewed by other Internet users, without your knowledge and permission, while in transit
            to us.
          </p>

          <p>
            We take reasonable security measures to protect against unauthorised access to or unauthorised alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These
            include firewalls and encryption, internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as
            physical security measures to guard against unauthorised access to systems. In addition, our software code resides on one set of servers and all
            data and information reside on a separate set of servers. We restrict access to personal information to our employees, contractors and agents who
            need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our Services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and
            may be subject to discipline, including termination, if they fail to meet these obligations. However, we are unable to guarantee that the security
            measures we take will not be penetrated or compromised or that your information will remain secure under all circumstances.
          </p>
        </span>

        <p className='font-bold'>Secure Information Storage</p>

        <p>
          The Company maintains administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to reasonably and appropriately protect the confidentiality, availability,
          and integrity of your Personal Information. For example, the file containing your Personal Information will be maintained in secure locations at our
          offices or on our servers (or those maintained by our service providers) with access limited to authorised employees, representatives, and agents. Our
          employees receive training on our security practices and obligations.
        </p>

        <p>
          Compliance with our security policies is periodically audited by our Chief Technology Officer and we continually assess the adequacy of, and where
          appropriate improve, our security controls and procedures. The Company&apos;s employees and our third-party service providers must abide by this
          policy and those who violate it are subject to corrective action, up to and including termination of employment or other legal action as permitted by
          law.
        </p>

        <p className='font-bold'>International Users</p>

        <span className='underline'>
          <p>
            The Website and Services are hosted in Europe. If you access the KudosHealth Sites or Services from the US, Asia, or any other region with laws or
            regulations governing personal data collection, use, and disclosure that differ from Irish law, please be advised that through your continued use of
            the KudosHealth Sites or Services, you are transferring your personal information to Europe and you consent to that transfer. Additionally, you
            understand that your personal information may be processed in countries (including the Ireland) where laws regarding processing personal information
            may be less stringent than in your country.
          </p>
        </span>

        <p className='font-bold'>Password Security</p>

        <p>
          You must be registered to use the Service. For most members, registration includes creation of a password. For these members, once you are registered,
          you will use a unique user ID and password to enter the Service. Your password is not accessible by the Company or its employees. If you lose your
          password, it cannot be retrieved. At your request, we will assist you in resetting your password.
        </p>

        <p>
          In some cases, your password and username will be managed and administered by your Sponsor, as you will be required to first log onto their site,
          which will then provide access to the Service.
        </p>

        <p>
          For your security, it is important for you to protect against unauthorised access to your password and your computer. If using a shared computer to
          access the Service, be sure to sign out when you are finished.
        </p>

        <p className='font-bold'>Email</p>

        <p>
          While we encrypt sensitive data, such as Personal Information, using SSL or VPN when it is transmitted over the Internet, we cannot completely ensure
          the privacy of email communications to and from our Site because they are not encrypted.
        </p>

        <p>
          For that reason, to protect your privacy, we ask that you do not use email messages to communicate information to us that you consider sensitive or
          confidential. The Company strives to protect the privacy of your personal information, but we cannot ensure or warrant the absolute security of any
          information you transmit to us electronically through the Service. When we receive an email transmission from you, we will use reasonable efforts to
          maintain the security of such information within our internal data systems.
        </p>

        <p>
          Depending on the nature of your inquiry or message, upon completion of the exchange with you, your message may be archived in our records or it may be
          deleted and discarded. If you have any concerns about the security of confidential or sensitive information, however, do not send such information to
          us by email or by telephone. We do not recommend that any health information or other confidential information be sent to us by email or telephone.
        </p>

        <p>
          E-mail services, including the e-mail functions within the Service, do not provide a completely secure and confidential means of communication. Even
          though it is unlikely, it is possible that your e-mail communication within the Service may be accessed or viewed inappropriately by another internet
          user while in transit to us. If you desire to ensure that your information is completely private, you should not communicate with us by e-mail.
        </p>

        <p>
          We may send you on a periodic basis electronic newsletter, notification of account status, and other communications, such as engagement or reminder
          communications. We may also send e-mail communications regarding Service updates and information on general health, fitness, and wellness topics. We
          will offer you appropriate consent mechanisms, such as opt-out, with respect to most of these online communications from us.
        </p>

        <p>For your protection, we will not send you an e-mail that includes your personal health information.</p>

        <p className='font-bold'>External Links on the Service</p>

        <p>
          The Service may provide links to various external websites that the Company does not control. When you click on one of these links, you will be
          automatically transferred away from the Service and connected to the linked websites of the organisation or company that you selected. We cannot be
          responsible for the content or information on such websites, nor for the accuracy of information or nature of opinions expressed on such websites. We
          do not conduct investigations of linked websites nor attempt to monitor them for content, quality, or accuracy. Inclusion of linked websites on the
          Service is strictly for the convenience of users and does not imply or express an approval or endorsement of the linked website by the Company. We do
          not express approval or endorsement of any products or services offered on or made available through such websites. In some cases, the Company may
          have an affiliation or business relationship with the operator of a linked website, but even in that situation, we exercise no control over the linked
          website.
        </p>

        <p>
          Each website linked to the Service maintains its own independent data collection procedure and privacy policy. The Company expects that all affiliated
          and unaffiliated third parties with which it has a business relationship, including the operators of linked websites, to respect the privacy of our
          users, but we are not responsible for the actions of such third parties. If you visit a website through a link in the Service, we encourage you to
          first review the written privacy policy posted on that website before furnishing any information or otherwise interacting with that website.
        </p>

          disputes concerning the Service and this Policy. This Policy and the notices and statements included are not intended to and do not create any
          contractual or other legal rights in or on behalf of any third party.

        <p className='font-bold'>Sponsors&apos; Privacy Policies</p>

        <p>
          In some instances, portions of the Service may be branded or co-branded by a Sponsor or made available via a Sponsor&apos;s website or landing page.
          If you visit or use the Service under such circumstances, you consent to both the Company&apos;s and the Sponsor&apos;s collection and use of your

          subject to the Sponsor&apos;s separate privacy policy.
