          copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner’s behalf.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you believe that your user content that was removed (or to which access was disabled) is not infringing, or that you have the authorization from
          the copyright owner, the copyright owner’s agent, or pursuant to the law, to post and use the content in your user content, you may send a
          counter-notice containing the following information to the copyright agent: (1) Your physical or electronic signature; (2) identification of the
          content that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the content appeared before it was removed or disabled;

          content; and (4) your name, address, telephone number, and email address, a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the Irish courts and a
          statement that you will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of the alleged infringement. If a counter-notice is
          received by the copyright agent, we may send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party informing that person that it may replace
          the removed content or cease disabling it in 10 business days. Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court order against the content
          provider, member or user, the removed content may be replaced, or access to it restored, in 10 to 14 business days or more after receipt of the
          counter-notice, at our sole discretion.
